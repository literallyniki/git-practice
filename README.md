[Software Engineers' Pay is Rising Faster Outside Silicon Valley](https://www.wsj.com/articles/software-engineers-pay-is-rising-faster-outside-silicon-valley-11581550773)


## Comment on Article

Overall wages for software engineers seem to be exhibiting a rising trend outside of Silicon Valley rather than within it. Tech operations are expanding immensely in other cities, and companies are fighting for local tech talent while trying to outbid each other in startup heavy cities around the world. Cities like Austin, Seattle, and London are all growing quickly in terms of tech bandwith, and the need for software engineers is only causing the pay grade to rise too.

The average salaries for a top level software engineer in SF/Bay Area tends to range from $155,000 to $165,000 (in 2019, which is a 6% increase from 2018). This trend is not only apparent in Silicon valley, but in any city demonstrating a growth in the tech sector. Overall, the number of IT job postings by U.S. companies increased by 52,090 last month over December, pushing the total number of unfilled tech positions above 350,000. It is no secret that as demand for this job increases, the pay will too, no matter where in the world software engineers are needed.

## Comment by Edward Cheung

I think it makes a lot of sense that Software Engineer wages are increasing outside of Silicon Valley. As the tech industry continues to grow, the demand for Software Engineers will increase all throughout the world. Since Silicon Valley is already a heavily tech centric area, there is far less room for growth in it.
